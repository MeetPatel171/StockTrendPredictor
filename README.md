# Stock Trend Prediction Web Application in Python

## Introduction

This project is a Stock Trend Prediction Web Application built using Python and Streamlit. The application utilizes machine learning techniques to predict the stock trends of a given company based on historical stock data from Yahoo Finance. The prediction model is implemented using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks.

## Usage

You can access the web application using the following link: [Stock Trends Predictor](https://stocktrendspredictor.streamlit.app)

To use the application, follow these steps:

Enter the stock ticker symbol (e.g., AAPL for Apple Inc.) in the text input and press enter.

The application will display the stock's historical data, closing price vs. time charts, and a chart showing the predicted price vs. original price.

## Note

Please make sure to have a reliable internet connection to fetch the latest stock data from Yahoo Finance.
